When you are in a good mood, you can make a joke or discuss a controversial matter rationally. However, after any reason affects your mood, the joke becomes an insult, the discussion becomes an argument, and finally you blush and break up unhappily."}]},{title:"Programmer 'lying flat' is the most correct choice",url:"/Charles/en/plan/two/",context:[{content:"Under the impact of the wave of 'inner curling', we see that many young people choose to lie flat to deal with the pressure. In fact, the two phenomena of 'inner curling' and 'lying flat' have always existed. Only recently, with the development of Internet information, people have noticed these and labeled them with these two vivid terms. Programmers are the first group to realize the inner volume, because from beginning to end, programmers need to maintain their learning ability in order not to be eliminated in the inner volume. If they feel heavy pressure, lying flat is the right choice."}]},{title:"How to guarantee the quality and quantity of technical blog writing?",url:"/Charles/en/plan/three/",context:[{content:"It has been 13 years since I came into contact with programming. When I participated in the training in 2010, under the influence of teachers, I opened a blog on CSDN and began my writing journey. At that time, writing seemed very simple. Many people read it by summarizing what they learned in class and the problems they usually encounter. Later, due to work reasons, I didn't have time to write. For more than ten years, it seems that blogging has become more and more difficult."},{content:"More and more software development is being carried out. More and more articles on blog platforms have led to a very competitive competition. If not for the sake of quality, there is no official account, and now there are too many content platforms. There are public numbers and headlines. There are also CSDN, SF, nugget Technology professionals, and the recommended algorithms for each platform are different. It's too tired to study it."}]},{title:"What is the front end?",url:"/Charles/en/plan/four/",context:[{content:"First define what is the front end. In a broad sense, any interface that can be seen by our human eyes and can conduct human-computer interaction belongs to the front-end category, such as app, website, applet, etc., and even the display screen on intelligent hardware (such as TV). From this point of view, as long as human-computer interaction is required, the front-end development will always be useful. I think you should also know that human-computer interaction is unlikely to disappear in a modern society with such developed science and technology, or in a short time."},{content:"After understanding this concept, do you think there is a future in front-end learning? ‌‌"}]}]}),methods:{goUrl(e){window.location.href=e}}},o=n(22),r=Object(o.a)(a,(function(){var e=this,t=e.$createElement,n=e._self._c||t;return n("ContentSlotsDistributor",{attrs:{"slot-key":e.$parent.slotKey}},[[e._l(e.cardList,(function(t,a){return n("el-card",{key:a,staticClass:"box-card",staticStyle:{"margin-bottom":"40px"}},[n("div",{staticClass:"clearfix",attrs:{slot:"header"},slot:"header"},[n("span",{staticStyle:{"font-weight":"bold"}},[e._v(e._s(a+1)+" "+e._s(t.title))])]),e._v(" "),e._l(t.context,(function(t){return n("p",{staticClass:"text item",staticStyle:{"font-size":"12px"}},[e._v("\n    "+e._s(t.content)+"\n  ")])})),e._v(" "),n("span",{staticStyle:{"font-size":"12px"}},[e._v(e._s(e.currentYear))]),e._v(" "),n("el-button",{staticStyle:{float:"right",padding:"3px 0"},attrs:{type:"text"},on:{click:function(n){return e.goUrl(t.url)}}},[e._v("READ ALL")])],2)})),e._v(" "),n("audio",{ref:"audio",attrs:{src:"https://img.youpenglai.com/penglai/1.mp3",autoplay:"",loop:"",preload:"auto"}})]],2)}),[],!1,null,"29c86c04",null);t.default=r.exports}}]);
